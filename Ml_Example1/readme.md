ML Example 1: 

I have this working using Anconda with an a Python 3 environment.

The steps I took;
1 start Anconda
2. Create Eb=nvironment with higest level of Python in the drop down
3. Add libraries to the environment.
   Select keras, tensorflow and then install them.
   
Two ways to go here;

Using Jupyter Notebook;  (this isn't working for me so please let me know if you get it up and running)
Install and then launch Jupyter Notebook's in the environment.
Once jypiter (web server is running, navigate to the folder and open it)

Using VS Code; (this worked for me)
Install and launch VS Code
